# sass-pugjs
I have created a web project consisting of 8 pages and utilized Sass and PugJS technologies.\
Sass is a CSS extension language that enhances code organization, while PugJS is an HTML template engine that simplifies the creation of clean page structures.\
Using these technologies requires compiling Sass files into CSS and converting Pug files into HTML.\
